                            People of all ages are being affected by the deadly coronavirus. While it is true that older people are at higher risk of developing a more serious infection, there are also immunocompromised people of all ages who face the same risks. Even young, healthy people are not immune to COVID-19. Older persons with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart ailments, etc. seem to be more susceptible to being infected by the novel coronavirus.

                            While the Pneumonia vaccine such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, is known to cure pneumonia, there is no evidence that this vaccine can be used against the COVID-19. This virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, and WHO is supporting their efforts.

                            Garlic is known to contain several health benefits. Due to its antimicrobial properties, people assume it can also help us in protecting ourselves from COVID-19 infection. However, it does not protect you against the virus. There is no evidence that they can help protect you against contracting the virus.

They are great for keeping your home and workspace clean and disinfected, but they won’t have the same effect on your body. In fact, they are harmful and should not be consumed. But using them on your body can be harmful for your clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).

                            While it has been found that the novel coronavirus was transmitted from an animal to man; till now there are no known animal species to carry this virus. The virus doesn’t spread through consumption of meat—chicken, mutton, or fish, and avoiding it doesn’t mean you will be safe. It can be spread when someone comes in contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person. And the only way to prevent this is by using hand sanitizers regularly, washing hands before eating anything and following social distancing. Ensure you consume meat or non-vegetarian foods prepared with hygiene care.

                            This myth started when a dog was tested positive in Hong Kong. But later it was found that it was because the dog owner was infected with the virus, and when tested, the virus was found in the dog’s canine. However, WHO stepped in telling that coronavirus in dogs is not possible. Also, there is no evidence that pets can spread the virus to humans. However, it is known that animals can spread other types of diseases so it is always good to follow healthy habits when you are around pets.

                            As per the guidelines provided by WHO, people of all age groups can contract the deadly novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. Older people with pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, heart ailments, etc. seem to be more susceptible to being infected by the novel coronavirus. However, this risk of getting infected by this virus is also for the younger age group.

                            Some people with COVID-19, or other viruses, will be visibly sick. However, many people with COVID-19 may be asymptomatic, which means they feel perfectly healthy. Asymptomatic patients feel well and appear fine to others. They can still spread a virus to others and therefore can make other people sick. While the COVID-19 pandemic continues, both healthy and sick people should wear masks or face coverings while around others to try to prevent spread of the virus.

                            Coronavirus symptoms for most of the infected people include cough, mild fevers, sore throat, headache, and body ache. While drinking warm water can make you feel better, there is no evidence that it will cure you. Having a bath in hot water won't work either. It does not matter at what temperature you take your bath or shower. According to WHO,  the body temperature remains at an average of 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower.

                            There is no evidence or information to suggest that the COVID-19 virus transmitted through houseflies/mosquitoes. COVID-19 is a respiratory virus which spreads through the discharge of droplets while coughing and sneezing or through discharge from the nose or through droplets of saliva. You may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.

                            Antibiotics are effective in fighting against bacteria. COVID-19 is a virus so it cannot be treated or used as a prevention measure against the novel coronavirus. Also, several drug trials are ongoing, but there is currently no proof that any drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat COVID-19 by supporting the researchers in developing the vaccine for novel coronavirus.

                            When you exhale, carbon dioxide leaves your lungs and exits the body through your nose or mouth. Carbon dioxide is a gas made up of small molecules. These molecules are so small that they can pass through many materials, including the materials used to make masks. If you are using a medical-grade or cloth mask, carbon dioxide will pass through safely. It will not accumulate inside the mask or make you sick. Remember that wearing a mask may be a new experience for you, but medical providers have been wearing masks safely for decades to protect themselves while helping others.

                            Thermal scanners can detect people who have a fever. However, they cannot detect those who are infected by the COVID-19 disease but have not developed a fever. Persons infected by the novel coronavirus take some time to develop a fever which can be between 2 to 10 days. Hence, thermal scanners cannot detect if a person is infected by the virus.

                            The body’s immune response to COVID-19 is still a mystery, and a small and growing number of cases suggest it’s possible to catch the virus twice. It’s unclear whether antibody responses are maintained or if they provide protection from again getting infected. Available research indicates not all recovered patients develop antibodies for immunity after infection. Some patients, particularly asymptomatic ones, produce antibodies immediately after infection only to have them disappear shortly afterward.
